## Design

The first step, as with all 3D printing, is obtaining a digital model of your 3D design. For this tutorial, we used Fusion 360 modelling software to write the text ‘Make it Yourself’, and extruded it to a height of 2 mm. We also used open source models from Thingiverse of a heart (hsmag.cc/hTxzNp), and spikes (hsmag.cc/ZDNHSp). 

Whether you decide to make your own design or use an existing model, you will end up with an STL file that is now ready for slicing.
