## Print
Wow, so many settings, but we promise it’s worth it. Now it’s time for the fun part. Print!

With your gcode ready, you can now pass it on to the printer and start seeing your 3D design emerge on the fabric, as if by science.
You can print with any standard PLA filament. We printed our designs with 1.75mm PLA filament in white and black, but you can go mad.
The prints do come off the fabric (cleanly!) if you pull them hard enough, so we see this as a one-time decoration method that you can peel off and change for a different one after a few wears.  

This is just the beginning of our experiments, and we are constantly learning. Do you have tips or tricks to share? Get in touch! 
This tutorial is the result of our collaboration with Josef Dunne at Champion 3D, who consulted us on best practices for 3D printing and helped make these 3D prints possible on fabric (champion3d.com).
