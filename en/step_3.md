## Slice

Slicing your STL is the step where you tell the 3D printer exactly how you want to print the model. You will do this with slicing software such as Simplify3D, which we used to slice the models prior to printing on our Witbox 2 printer. 

Tuning the slicer settings for your specific printer model can be a fine art. We used these settings for printing PLA onto fabric: nozzle temperature of 200, layer height of 200 microns, 50 mm/sec print speed, 2 mm retraction (extruder specific). 

Most slicing software will require you to enter these settings, but you may have to fine-tune them slightly if you are using a different 3D printer. This can involve some trial and error. Once you have set the settings, export the sliced file as gcode, which will be read by your 3D printer.

title: Other ways to attach 3D prints to fabric
---
- In the 3D slicer settings, add a ‘skirt’ to your design, which is basically an outline around your model, several shells thick, that will adhere to the fabric (as in the photo with the spikes). You can then sew through this skirt with a needle and thread, which will permanently attach the print.  
- Print the text letters or design you need directly onto the print bed as you would normally (not onto fabric), and then attach them to the fabric with thread, as you would attach an embellishment.
